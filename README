Geocoder

========

It geocodes an address based on OSI Gazetteer Counties and Townlands. 

## Database

Database build script can be found in DDL.sql. It assumes that Counties and Townland CSV files are in /tmp.

Install posgis according to instructions here: https://postgis.net/install/

Create PostgreSQL database with:

createuser -dprs geocoder
createdb geocoder -O geocoder

Then run:

```
psql -d geocoder -f DDL.sql
```

## Environment

Pipenv is used to do packages. I'm using python 3.8.
With python 3.8 installed, install pipenv with:

```
pip3 install --user Pipenv
```

Navigate to the project directory and run:

```
pipenv install
```

## tests

No test runner is installed. There are two test modules. 
One for the interfaces: tests.py
One for the geocoder: geocoder/tests.py
Tests can be run by executing the test files with:

```
python tests.py
python geocoder/tests.py
```

## Applications

Run a command line application with:

```
python geocode_cli.py ADDRESS
```
or run a web application with

```
./run_webapp.sh
```

Optionally to run in dev mode:
```
export FLASK_ENV=development
```

Then use a browser to navigate to:

```
http://localhost:5000/geocoder?address=<ADDRESS>
```
